	<p>Hello World!!! CHANGE TO SEE IN GIT<br>
	<!-- interesting In XHTML, the <br> tag must be properly closed, like this: <br />.-->
	test content only to continue with the git lessons
	<br>what is version control?
	<br>system that will record versions of your file over time, archives snapshots of differences, store changes, distribute work load<br>
	<br>there are many version control systems
	<br>"use-case" is a phrase that keeps coming up
	<br> version control system, git is a type of version control
	<br> git has 3 states - working directory (where you do your work), staging (where your changes go before adding to repository), git directory (all your code and history and git meta-data is here)
	<br> start tracking: maker, staging product in heap, git repository freight truck for distribution [ids are generated here]
	</p>

	<p>
	git commands! in terminal 
	<br><!--create--> $ git init
	<br><!--check it--> $ ls -a
	<br><!--check it--> $ git status
	<br><!--add a doc--> $ git add index.html
	<br><!--check it--> $ git status
	<br><!--make changes--> to the html file
	<br><!--check it--> $ git status
	<br><!--add a new version of doc--> $ git add index.html 
	<br><!--note that the file has replaced itself-->
	<br>use committ instead to save versions
	<br>git commit -m "Jessica initial commit of the index html file" // messsage is to add a note 
	<br>git log

<br>exercise: 
<br>change html
<br>check status
<br>add changes in staging // always just use git add and it will update the repository - to stage
<br>commit changes to git repository // use git commit - to git repository
<br> git log, git help

<p>
<br> github is a hosting service, can store files on servers
<br> want to take local to github.com, login to your account, connect the remote and local
<br>remote is the "origin" 
<br>add this on bash git remote add origin https://github.com/JessicaParrisWestbrook/women-who-code.git
 <br>then combine them git push -u origin master // this is push from master (local) to remote (origin)
<br> -u is upstream // this is somehow retained
<br> Username for 'https://github.com': git push -u origin master
Password for 'https://git push -u origin master@github.com': 
<br> I MAKE A CONTENT CHANGE HERE

<br>seems to need to have to go to the staging site then it needs to go repository
<br> change local, git add, git status, git commit, git status, git push
<br> (git add. does ALL files) // this is for multiples
